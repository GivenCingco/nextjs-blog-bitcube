I separated the Terraform code from the application code for several reasons:
	•	Maintainability: Infrastructure and application code can be managed and updated independently.
	•	Security: Sensitive information, like AWS credentials, is stored as GitHub secrets, reducing exposure risks.
	•	Clarity: This separation clarifies the project’s architecture, distinguishing infrastructure from application logic.
	•	Collaboration: Teams can work concurrently on infrastructure and application code, improving workflow efficiency.
